## Purpose

The Weather App is a web application that provides weather forecasts for any location. It was built as a way to learn how to use Node and Express for the backend, and Handlebars for the frontend.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind the development of the Weather App was to learn how to use Node and Express to create a functional web application, and to learn how to use APIs to retrieve and display data. This project was also an opportunity to practice coding skills and improve proficiency in these technologies.

## Tech Stack

The Weather App was built using the following technologies:

-   Node: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
-   Express: A web framework for Node.js
-   Handlebars: A templating engine for creating dynamic HTML pages
-   Weatherstack API: A weather API used to retrieve weather forecast data
-   Mapbox API: A location API used to retrieve location information

## Features

The Weather App includes the following features:

-   Weather forecasts: Users can enter a location to get the current weather forecast, including the weather description, temperature, feels like temperature, wind speed, pressure, humidity, and UV index.
-   Location search: Users can search for locations using the Mapbox API to get the weather forecast for that location.

## Challenges

One issue that I encountered while building the Weather App was the challenge of integrating the various APIs and making sure that the data is displayed correctly on the frontend. This involved troubleshooting issues with the API calls and handling any errors that may occur.

Furthermore, the Weatherstack API documentation that I was following initially was of a deprecated version. Therefore, to make everything work as planned, I had to switch over to the new version half way through the project. This involved lots of debugging and learning more about node/npm.

## Accomplishments

By building the Weather App, I achieved a number of accomplishments, including:

-   Learning how to use Node and Express to create a functional web application
-   Improving proficiency in coding skills and using Node, Express, and Handlebars
-   Creating a functional web application that retrieves and displays weather forecast data using APIs
-   Deploying the Weather App on a platform such as Heroku so it can be accessed by anyone with a link.

## Future Changes

There are a number of things that could be done to improve the Weather App in the future. Some potential improvements could include:

-   Adding additional weather data and features, such as forecasted temperature and weather conditions for specific times of the day
-   Implementing a user interface that allows users to customize their weather experience, such as selecting preferred units of measurement
-   Adding support for additional locations and languages
-   Integrating with additional APIs to provide more comprehensive weather data and features.
